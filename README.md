# jitlist
pronounced "hitlist". it's the epitome of data structures. optimized for optimization.

## seriously
that bit about being optimized for optimization is true. it's for optimizing a list of bytecode instructions by removal and replacement.
it supports no insertion or iteration. only indexing and removal. it's O(1) removal and -- technically, 'cause it's jit compiled -- O(1)
indexing.

## why?
